### Project Description
A chaotic test of your reflexes and your patience! Match the colours of the tiles to the word on your screen while the timer runs. To add more chaos a random brainrot is dropped at every 5 seconds. Can you survive the the mayhem without losing your cool?

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Tackles the most overlooked crisis of people having too much peace and mental stability!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A perfectly balanced mixture of chaos and trolling. Philippinte Pani keeps you on your toes with rapid fire colour challenges and sabotages your focus with unskippable and unseekable brainrot videos. Tests your reflexes, patience and not throwing your laptop across the room.
