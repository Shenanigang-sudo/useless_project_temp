### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Tackles the most overlooked crisis of people having too much peace and mental stability!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A perfectly balanced mixture of chaos and trolling. Philippinte Pani keeps you on your toes with rapid fire colour challenges and sabotages your focus with unskippable and unseekable brainrot videos. Tests your reflexes, patience and not throwing your laptop across the room.
